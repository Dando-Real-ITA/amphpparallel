# amphp/parallel

AMPHP is a collection of event-driven libraries for PHP designed with fibers and concurrency in mind.
`amphp/parallel` provides *true parallel processing* for PHP using multiple processes, *without blocking and no extensions required*.

To be as flexible as possible, this library comes with a collection of non-blocking concurrency tools that can be used independently as needed, as well as an "opinionated" worker API that allows you to assign units of work to a pool of worker processes.

## Installation

This package can be installed as a [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) dependency.

```bash
composer require amphp/parallel
```

## Usage

The basic usage of this library is to submit blocking tasks to be executed by a worker pool in order to avoid blocking the main event loop.

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

use Amp\Future;
use Amp\Parallel\Worker;
use function Amp\async;

$urls = [
    'https://secure.php.net',
    'https://amphp.org',
    'https://github.com',
];

$executions = [];
foreach ($urls as $url) {
    // FetchTask is just an example, you'll have to implement
    // the Task interface for your task.
    $executions[$url] = Worker\submit(new FetchTask, $url);
}

// Each submission returns an Execution instance to allow two-way
// communication with a task. Here we're only interested in the
// task result, so we use the Future from Execution::getResult()
$responses = Future\await(array_map(
    fn (Worker\Execution $e => $e->getResult(),
    $executions,
));

foreach ($responses as $url => $response) {
    \printf("Read %d bytes from %s\n", \strlen($response), $url);
}
```

`FetchTask` is just used as an example for a blocking function here.
If you just want to fetch multiple HTTP resources concurrently, it's better to use [`amphp/http-client`](https://amphp.org/http-client/), our non-blocking HTTP client.

> **Note**
> The functions you call must be predefined or autoloadable by Composer, so they also exist in the worker processes.

### Workers

`Worker` provides a simple interface for executing PHP code in parallel in a separate PHP process.
Classes implementing [`Task`](#tasks) are used to define the code to be run in parallel.

### Tasks

The `Task` interface has a single `run()` method that gets invoked in the worker to dispatch the work that needs to be done.
The `run()` method can be written using blocking code since the code is executed in a separate process.

Task instances are `serialize`'d in the main process and `unserialize`'d in the worker.
That means that all data that is passed between the main process and a worker needs to be serializable.

In the example below, a `Task` is defined which calls a blocking function (`file_get_contents()` is only an example of a blocking function, use [`http-client`](https://amphp.org/http-client) for non-blocking HTTP requests).

Child processes executing tasks may be reused to execute multiple tasks.

```php
use Amp\Cache\AtomicCache;
use Amp\Cancellation;
use Amp\Parallel\Worker\Task;
use Amp\Sync\Channel;

class FetchTask implements Task
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly string $url,
    ) {
    }

    public function run(
        Channel $channel,
        AtomicCache $cache,
        Cancellation $cancellation,
    ): string {
        return file_get_contents($url); // Example blocking function
    }
}
```

```php
use Amp\Parallel\Worker\DefaultWorker;

$worker = new DefaultWorker();
$task = new FetchTask('https://amphp.org');

$execution = $worker->submit($task);

$future = $execution->getResult();

// $data will be the return value from FetchTask::run()
$data = $future->await(); 
```

#### Sharing data between tasks

`Task::run()` is provided an `AtomicCache` object which is shared amongst all tasks executed on a single child process, including across different `Task` implementations. This storage can be used to access and store data between task executions and reuse resources initiated by prior tasks, such as a database connection or open file handle. A worker may be executing multiple tasks, so consider using the methods of `AtomicCache` which guarantee mutual exclusion when creating or updating cache values if a task uses async I/O to generate a cache value.

#### Task cancellation

A `Cancellation` provided to `Worker::submit()` may be used to request cancellation of the task in the worker. When cancellation is requested in the parent, the `Cancellation` provided to `Task::run()` is cancelled. The task may choose to ignore this cancellation request or act accordingly and throw a `CancelledException` from `Task::run()`. If the cancellation request is ignored, the task may continue and return a value which will be returned to the parent as though cancellation had not been requested.

### Worker Pools

The easiest way to use workers is through a worker pool.
Worker pools can be used to submit tasks in the same way as a worker, but rather than using a single worker process, the pool uses multiple workers to execute tasks.
This allows multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously.

The `WorkerPool` interface extends [`Worker`](#workers), adding methods to get information about the pool or pull a single `Worker` instance out of the pool.
A pool uses multiple `Worker` instances to execute [`Task`](#tasks) instances.

If a set of tasks should be run within a single worker, use the `WorkerPool::getWorker()` method to pull a single worker from the pool.
The worker is automatically returned to the pool when the instance returned is destroyed.

#### Global Worker Pool

A global worker pool is available and can be set using the function `Amp\Parallel\Worker\workerPool(?WorkerPool $pool = null)`.
Passing an instance of `WorkerPool` will set the global pool to the given instance.
Invoking the function without an instance will return the current global instance.

### Child Processes

The `ProcessContext` class simplifies writing and running PHP in parallel.
A script written to be run in parallel must return a callable that will be run in a child process.
The callable receives a single argument â€“ an instance of `Channel` that can be used to send data between the parent and child processes. Any serializable data can be sent across this channel.
The `Context` object, which extends the `Channel` interface, is the other end of the communication channel.

In the example below, a child process is used to call a blocking function (`file_get_contents()` is only an example of a blocking function, use [`http-client`](https://amphp.org/http-client) for non-blocking HTTP requests).
The result of that function is then sent back to the parent using the `Channel` object.
The return value of the child process callable is available using the `Context::join()` method.

#### Child Process

```php
# child.php

use Amp\Sync\Channel;

return function (Channel $channel): mixed {
    $url = $channel->receive();

    $data = file_get_contents($url); // Example blocking function

    $channel->send($data);

    return 'Any serializable data';
};
```

#### Parent Process

```php
# parent.php

use Amp\Parallel\Context\ProcessContext;

// Creates and starts a child process context using ProcessContext
$context = ProcessContext::start(__DIR__ . '/child.php');

$url = 'https://google.com';
$context->send($url);

$requestData = $context->receive();
printf("Received %d bytes from %s\n", \strlen($requestData), $url);

$returnValue = $context->join();
printf("Child processes exited with '%s'\n", $returnValue);
```

Child processes are also great for CPU-intensive operations such as image manipulation or for running daemons that perform periodic tasks based on input from the parent.

### Context creation

An execution context can be created using the function `Amp\Parallel\Context\startContext()`, which uses the global `ContextFactory`. The global factory is an instance of `DefaultContextFactory` by default, but this instance can be overridden using the function `Amp\Parallel\Context\contextFactory()`.

Context factories are used by worker pools to create the context which executes tasks. Providing a custom `ContextFactory` to a worker pool allows custom bootstrapping or other behavior within pool workers.

An execution context can be created by a `ContextFactory`. The worker pool uses context factories to create workers.

A global worker pool is available and can be set using the function `Amp\Parallel\Worker\workerPool(?WorkerPool $pool = null)`.
Passing an instance of `WorkerPool` will set the global pool to the given instance.
Invoking the function without an instance will return the current global instance.

### Debugging

Step debugging may be used in child processes with PhpStorm and Xdebug by listening for debug connections in the IDE.

In PhpStorm settings, under `PHP > Debug`, ensure the box "Can accept external connections" is checked. The specific ports used are not important, yours may differ.

For child processes to connect to the IDE and stop at breakpoints set in the child processes, turn on listening for debug connections.

**Listening off:**

<img src="https://amphp.org/asset/img/packages/parallel/debug-listen-off.png" alt="Debug listening off" width="350"/> 

**Listening on:**

<img src="https://amphp.org/asset/img/packages/parallel/debug-listen-on.png" alt="Debug listening on" width="350"/>

No PHP ini settings need to be set manually. Settings set by PhpStorm when invoking the parent PHP process will be forwarded to child processes.

Run the parent script in debug mode from PhpStorm with breakpoints set in code executed in the child process. Execution should stop at any breakpoints set in the child.

**Debugger running:**

<img src="https://amphp.org/asset/img/packages/parallel/debug-running.png" alt="Debug running" width="350"/>

When stopping at a breakpoint in a child process, execution of the parent process and any other child processes will continue. PhpStorm will open a new debugger tab for each child process connecting to the debugger, so you may need to limit the amount of child processes created when debugging or the number of connections may become overwhelming! If you set breakpoints in the parent and child process, you may need to switch between debug tabs to resume both the parent and child.
