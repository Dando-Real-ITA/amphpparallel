# amphp/parallel

AMPHP is a collection of event-driven libraries for PHP designed with fibers and concurrency in mind.
`amphp/parallel` provides *true parallel processing* for PHP using multiple processes or native threads, *without blocking and no extensions required*.

To be as flexible as possible, this library comes with a collection of non-blocking concurrency tools that can be used independently as needed, as well as an "opinionated" worker API that allows you to assign units of work to a pool of worker threads or processes.

## Installation

This package can be installed as a [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) dependency.

```bash
composer require amphp/parallel
```

## Usage

The basic usage of this library is to submit blocking tasks to be executed by a worker pool in order to avoid blocking the main event loop.

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

use Amp\Future;
use Amp\Parallel\Worker;
use function Amp\async;

$urls = [
    'https://secure.php.net',
    'https://amphp.org',
    'https://github.com',
];

$futures = [];
foreach ($urls as $url) {
    // FetchTask is just an example, you'll have to implement the Task interface for your task
    $futures[$url] = async(fn () => Worker\submit(new FetchTask, $url));
}

$responses = Future\await($futures);

foreach ($responses as $url => $response) {
    \printf("Read %d bytes from %s\n", \strlen($response), $url);
}
```

`FetchTask` is just used as an example for a blocking function here.
If you just want to fetch multiple HTTP resources concurrently, it's better to use [`amphp/http-client`](https://amphp.org/http-client/), our non-blocking HTTP client.

> **Note**
> The functions you call must be predefined or autoloadable by Composer, so they also exist in the worker processes.

## Workers

`Worker` provides a simple interface for executing PHP code in parallel in a separate PHP process or thread.
Classes implementing [`Task`](#tasks) are used to define the code to be run in parallel.

## Tasks

The `Task` interface has a single `run()` method that gets invoked in the worker to dispatch the work that needs to be done.
The `run()` method can be written using blocking code since the code is executed in a separate process or thread.

Task instances are `serialize`'d in the main process and `unserialize`'d in the worker.
That means that all data that is passed between the main process and a worker needs to be serializable.

## Worker Pools

The easiest way to use workers is through a worker pool.
Worker pools can be used to submit tasks in the same way as a worker, but rather than using a single worker process or thread, the pool uses multiple workers to execute tasks.
This allows multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously.

The `WorkerPool` interface extends [`Worker`](#workers), adding methods to get information about the pool or pull a single `Worker` instance out of the pool.
A pool uses multiple `Worker` instances to execute [`Task`](#tasks) instances.

If a set of tasks should be run within a single worker, use the `WorkerPool::getWorker()` method to pull a single worker from the pool.
The worker is automatically returned to the pool when the instance returned is destroyed.

### Global Worker Pool

A global worker pool is available and can be set using the function `Amp\Parallel\Worker\workerPool(?WorkerPool $pool = null)`.
Passing an instance of `WorkerPool` will set the global pool to the given instance.
Invoking the function without an instance will return the current global instance.

## Processes and Threads

The `Process` and `Parallel` classes simplify writing and running PHP in parallel.
A script written to be run in parallel must return a callable that will be run in a child process (or a thread if [`ext-parallel`](https://github.com/krakjoe/parallel) is installed).
The callable receives a single argument â€“ an instance of `Channel` that can be used to send data between the parent and child processes. Any serializable data can be sent across this channel.
The `Context` object, which extends the `Channel` interface, is the other end of the communication channel.

In the example below, a child process or thread is used to call a blocking function (`file_get_contents()` is only an example of a blocking function, use [`http-client`](https://amphp.org/http-client) for non-blocking HTTP requests).
The result of that function is then sent back to the parent using the `Channel` object.
The return value of the child process callable is available using the `Context::join()` method.

### Child Process or Thread

```php
# child.php

use Amp\Parallel\Sync\Channel;

return function (Channel $channel): mixed {
    $url = $channel->receive();

    $data = file_get_contents($url); // Example blocking function

    $channel->send($data);

    return 'Any serializable data';
};
```

### Parent Process

```php
# parent.php

use Amp\Parallel\Context;

// Creates a context using Process, or if ext-parallel is installed, Parallel.
$context = Context\createContext(__DIR__ . '/child.php');

$pid = $context->start();

$url = 'https://google.com';
$context->send($url);

$requestData = $context->receive();
printf("Received %d bytes from %s\n", \strlen($requestData), $url);

$returnValue = $context->join();
printf("Child processes exited with '%s'\n", $returnValue);
```

Child processes are also great for CPU-intensive operations such as image manipulation or for running daemons that perform periodic tasks based on input from the parent.
